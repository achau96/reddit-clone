# Reddit-clone by Austin Chau built for TheOdinProject Capstone

## Objective

To apply everything I have learned to replicate my favourite social media website to the best of my abilities.

## Things I struggled on

1. Had to use "useRef" from react to create the focus input from search icon to input text.
2. Learned about iframes to plug in youtube videos.
3. Learned about files, file input, how to get the correct file data to upload onto storage. Limit to only images and videos.
